These recordings were made in the studios set by the company in Argentina. Althouse, Cheney, and Layton contributed significantly to these recording endeavors. (See: Cañardo, Fábricas de música). Yet, “Buenos Aires” as the place for many of tehse recordings appears as “unconfirmed” in DAHR, considering that the original ledgers seem to be irremediably lost. Apparently, there were other recording expeditions to Havana in March 1927 and in January-February 1928, and to Santiago (Chile) in the “winter” of 1928."
